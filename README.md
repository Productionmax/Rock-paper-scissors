A simple rock, paper and scissors game.
What I learned
  - I learned how to choose a random string from a string array
  - I learned how to receive a prompt that is case insensitive
  - I learned how to effectively use a for loop inside a function
  - And lastly, I learned how to make a rock-paper-scissors game!
